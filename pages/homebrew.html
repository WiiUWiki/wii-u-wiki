     <h1>Wii <a class="BlueU">U</a> Wiki - Homebrew Page</h1>
     <h3 id="welcome">Welcome to the homebrew page of the Wii U Wiki! Here, you can learn what homebrew is and even install CFW on your system.</h3>
     <h4>(And if you don&#39;t have a system, we have a <a href="/pages/buyingguide.html"><del>buying guide</del></a> page that will guide you on ways to find one and more!)</h4>
     <h2>Before beginning....</h2>
     <h3 id="what-is-homebrew">What is homebrew?</h3>
     <p>When it comes to video games, homebrew is any unofficial software accessible through some sort of method or exploit for closed/non-user-programmable video game systems. Performing such methods or exploits to a video game console is known as <strong>homebrewing</strong>, <strong>modding</strong>, <strong>jailbreaking</strong>, or <strong>hacking</strong>. With a homebrewed/modded/jailbroken/hacked Wii U, or a Wii U with <strong>Custom Firmware</strong> (CFW for short) installed, almost all barriers break.</p>
     <h3 id="uses-of-homebrew-on-wiiu">Ok... But what can you do with homebrew on the Wii U?</h3>
     <p>With homebrew, you can...</p>
     <ul>
     <li>Use emulators on your console.</li>
     <li>Play GameCube games.</li>
     <li>Run backups of Wii and Wii U games from an SD card or hard drive.</li>
     <li>Play region-locked games from other countries.</li>
     <li>Use homebrew software.</li>
     <li>Install and play mods for games.</li>
     <li>And more!</li>
     </ul>
     <p>With that being said, because of the power that homebrewing gives you to your console, it can also be used for malicious intent such as installing pirated games and/or using cheats to cheat online. We heavily encourage you to not use homebrew for these kind of purposes. </p>
     <h3 id="could-hb-cause-damage">Could homebrew cause damage/break your Wii U?</h3>
     <p>Yes-ish. There is always <em>very</em> small possible chance that your console could <strong>brick</strong> if anything you do is done improperly, you are messing with something that you shouldn&#39;t be messing with, or you&#39;re doing something but don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing. A <strong>bricked</strong> console is the equivalent of a console in a complete unusable state. In other words, Bricking a console is basically breaking it in a way that it fails to boot correctly. While there are ways to fix a brick, bricks can vary depending on what caused it, and for the most part you will need extra hardware or a hardmod on your Wii U to fix a brick. However, don&#39;t worry. As long as you carefully pay attention to this guide and know what you&#39;re doing, for which you are responsible for your actions, you shouldn&#39;t experience a brick.</p>
     <h3 id="so-you-want-to-hb-your-wiiu">So, say if you want to homebrew your Wii U.</h3>
     <p>Before proceeding, remember that:</p>
     <p>With homebrewing, you obtain more control over your console. With great power comes great responsibility. Thus, you are responsible for everything you do to your console. We nor anyone else is responsible for what you do.</p>
